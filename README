This is a plugin for Compiz 0.8 branch that allows user to have a 3D earth inside the cube, with realtime day and night.
Cube must, of course, be enabled.
Configure using ccsm. You can set the center of the view to your location, specifying longitude and latitude.
Don't forget to set your timezone. Daylight Savings Time is automatic.

Installation :
libGLEW is required !

$make && make install

Read changelog about updating from the very first version.

skydome.png in data dir (installed to ~/.compiz/data/) is to be used as an animated skydome.
It's a view of all the outer space visible from earth.

You don't have to specify texture files anymore, the plugin will automatically retrieve a day.png file for the day texture in ~/.compiz/data/.
For smaller screens, or graphic adapters with a small amount of video memory, you can resize the texture to yet a smaller size (please use power of two factors, it will be easier for your video card).



Changelog :

2011/08/18
Rewrote the entire plugin to be cleaner, faster (or using less ressources), with correct comments in English and in line with the compiz coding style.
Now the plugin automatically retrieves its textures from ~/.compiz/data/.
Corrected a bug when loading the textures.
Hardcoded the sphere generation to get rid of the GLU dependency.
Translated the configuration in English.
Resized skydome.png, day.png and night.png (not used yet) to a smaller yet still detailed enough resolution.
If you are updating from the first version, you can clean ~/.compiz/data, as for now any other file than day.png and skydome.png is not used.

2011/08/20
Shader support !!! The plugin will determine itself if shader are supported and use them (earth.vert and earth.frag in the data dir)
New cool effects : multitexture with night texture. Per-pixel lighting and specular reflexion on oceans.
libGLEW is now required to build the plugin.
